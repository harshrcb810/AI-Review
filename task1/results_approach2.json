It's two full weeks later and it looks like my pedicure is brand new (and before you ask, I actually used the exact same brand/color nail polish as my prior crap pedicure). They don't have the cool massage chairs and they put you in a weird little intimate back room, HOWEVER I would totally give that up for a beautiful pedicure that lasts this long.  \\n\\nThought it was worth a review.",

    "review": "I went here as a last resort after being unable to secure a table at Beef-n-Bottle, so my expectations in regards to meat quality that day were a little high.\\n\\nThe first thing to expect at Outback is a fairly long wait on weekends; if memory serves me correctly, the wait on a Saturday night was about 50 mins.  There is a small waiting area to the left of the door that has complimentary lemonade and they also pass out samples of appetizers.  This small space is a real life saver when it's really cold outside.\\n\\nRegarding the food, I recommend either the Victoria Filet or the New York strip (rare or medium rare).  Since the prices are so reasonable, you're basically looking at a $10-14 steak if you get the sirloin and based on the comments from the table next to us, a $10 piece of meat is what you're gonna get.  While we enjoyed our filet and New York strip, the couple next to us was unable to finish more than half of their sirloins.  They said that the meat was kind of tough and dry.  I personally found my strip to be tender and juicy, however it was lacking in the seasoning department, let just say I needed a lot of steak sauce.  The loaded baked potato was cooked well, but the cesar salad that I had was very bland.  The dressing had almost no taste and the parmesan cheese was bland with an odd peppery taste.\\n\\nThe service was great, our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  If you asked me if I'd return, I'd probably say no.  The food quality just isn't what I'm used to in the realm of steaks.  To be honest, I've had better steaks at some of Charlotte's local bars.  If you're on a limited budget and want a steak dinner for $20 or less, you can't beat the pricing here.",

    "review": "I'm on a quest to find a phoenix and dragon similar to my favorite Chinese place in Indy. This is the closet I've come, much to my disappointment. This restaurant keeps getting into my apartment building, despite the security doors. Today they just stuck them in the elevator. Which I thought was pretty neat compared to their normal door spamiming. Then I went down to the first floor and realized they also just scattered them all over the floor.\\n\\nIn my phoenix and dragon I had five \\\"jumbo\\\" shrimps. Which are really just average sized shrimp. The only thing I can think of is that they consider the mini shrimp some Chinese places have as normal. I guess compared to those the shrimp is jumbo. The \\\"spicy chicken\\\" is just general tso's. I got medium spice which was barely spicy at all. Most of my dish ended up being peas, carrots, and onions in a weird \\\"spicy\\\" sauce that wasn't very good.\\n\\nI also got the rangoons. Some one else mentioned in this that they don't really have much crab. Which is an understatement. There's maybe a flick of crab in each. They're still fairly good, just not crab.\\n\\nI suppose the worst part was delivery time. The confirmation email doesn't come with a estimated delivery. Whatever, my boyfriend and I expect 40 minutes like normal. 40 minute mark rolls around and we haven't gotten a call. Since our buzzer system isn't set up we were worried that they didn't see the note to call and were buzzing us. The person who answers says it's in the car and close. 20 minutes later we're still waiting. My boyfriend calls back and goes to give his info. The lady says, \\\"Oh, you just called. It's almost there,\\\" and that was it. Uhm. Ok. A little less than 10 minutes later and it arrives. The driver apologized and It was still hot.

    "review": "THIS PLACE NEEDS A MINUS 1\\nbecause I so have a beef with this restaurant. My husband loves steak. usually I am not a huge fan of going to a steakhouse but it was my husbands turn to choose so I insisted we go. It is not that I do not like steak only that I often find I prefer the steaks I grill at home to the ones served  out. I do however lloooove the fried onions alot of the steak places have but this one did not have one. BOO! Anyhoo......we decided to order what was supposed to be garlic-peppered fried zucchinn. It was fried nicely and not too oily, but I did not taste garlic or any pepper in the seasoning. It came oddly with a cucumber dip (I think it was creamy cucumber dressing) we asked for ranch instead. It just tasted off. I ordered  a grilled chicken breast that was supposed to be seasoned with rosemary and spices well again, no rosemary. My chicken was dry and boring. I ate maybe half of it.It came with a side of broccoli and what was supposed to be GARLIC MASHED POTATOES also another popular side item at most steakhouses. AGAIN, nothing but bad to say about both these items. FIRST. Frozen cut broccoli should never be served  at any restaurant. I only eat fresh steamed broccoli.When you list on the menu fresh seasoned veg of the day I think it will be just that fresh. Next, garlic mashed potatoes. Anyone that loves these knows they are made with cream and garlic and should be creamy comforting goodness. These potatoes were like I nuked a potato dumped the  insides on my plate and smashed it with some butter and garlic salt. When I  asksed the server about them because I refused to eat them , she said \\\"oh yes no we don't make them that way here we leave out cream because people have allergies\\\" OMG! What a joke! CREAM is the best thing about em! what would be the point otherwise?I told them they should tell people this before they order. She asked me if I wanted a baked potato instead. I looked at her and said\\\" that is what I have all I need is to add sourcream\\\".(I don't think she liked me)  Oh but wait my husbands was no better. He ordered prime rib. They brought it out fully cooked! The server acted annoyed we complained about it.They brought out another piece- we waited another 20 for that and then they did not even offer to dicount our meal. In fact a manager never even came to talk to us even though I know the server did talk to him about our meal. Good service to me is even more important than food at times.I would NEVER GO BACK HERE.

I figured I could use those services because the car is two years old, and the leather could use a cleaning. I agreed to that, and went inside to pay. The cost of the interior clean upgrade was significant, and I was expecting the job would reflect the cost of the service. The inside is nice. There are comfortable couches inside and TV. About 20 to 30 minutes pass, and my car was ready. I go out to look at the job they did, and it was very obvious that they did absolutely nothing to the seats. The rest of the interior was pretty clean but it wasn't an amazing job either. I commented on how the seats weren't cleaned to the guy who takes the ticket. His response was \\\"no, that is something different.\\\" I told him that the guy at the entrance said that the seats would be cleaned as well.

So Money that no one could confirm sat on the table when all I wanted to was grab my money and leave. The Manager on duty Monica  was so rude to me she did look at the tape (for 10-15 mins) and saw that it was my money and when I asked for my $3 back YES $3 that they couldn't confirm that was mine she tried to tell me I was trying to get over and scamming them. I WAS LIKE ARE YOU SERIOUS you guys make $3 in 0.02 seconds and you can't afford to give me $3???? She told me I had to make an appointment to speak to someone higher than her. the customer service was TERRRRIBLE and it did not stop there.\\n\\nThe next morning I called and asked to speak to the Operations Manager and he got on the phone and told me he would take a look at it and give me a call back and pretty much said what do you want and we cant give you anything more than $3.

(Other reasons include the proximity to the Neon Boneyard, the historic old-Vegas reputation of the hotel and the ratings on Trip Advisor.)\\n\\nHowever, the quality of my room was far below what I expected, or even dreamed was possible.\\n\\nI have very minimal requirements for hotel rooms; generally I only want them to be clean (not spotless, clean) and relatively safe. Non-smoking is also on the list.\\n\\nMy room at the 4 Queens was the filthiest hotel room I've ever stayed in.\\n\\nThere was hair (of the nether-region variety) in the bathtub. In fact, I don't think the shower or bathtub were touched by house cleaning before or during my stay. I don't like to make a fuss so wiped-everything down myself, and was too exhausted to switch rooms on top of that.\\n\\nEvery surface in the room felt greasy. I'm going to say it was covered in some Pledge-like substance (humor me) to make myself feel better.\\n\\nThere was an empty packet of Lucky Strike cigarettes behind the one side of the drapes and a lighter on the other when I arrived, and spotted quite easily. This was touted to be a non-smoking room. I left the empty cigarette pack and lighter for the duration of my stay to see of it would be eventually picked-up by the housekeeping staff. \\n\\nNope; no such luck.\\n\\nAdditionally, there were cigarette burns in the bedding (which was made of some, scratchy, ugly cheap fabric). Two of the three lamps in the room did not work. At all. The remote did not work. The air conditioner was very, very loud.\\n\\nI didn't realized that the Academy of Country Music awards we're being held in the city the weekend I stayed, and on the 15th floor, I could hear the awful cover bands from Fremont Street quite clearly. Granted, I should have realized the ACMs were the weekend of my stay, but the noise was a bit ridiculous.\\nOh, and the folks staying in the room next door smoked weed every night of my stay. I dare say I could very well have gotten a contact-high the smell was so strong.\\n\\nLuckily, I take Ambien to sleep, and am dead to the world at night. Even with the Ambien, the world's rattliest, loudest air conditioner, still woke me up several times each night. This is in addition to being woken by the amazingly loud sex the reefer users next door were having. Otherwise there is absolutely no way I would have gotten any rest in this hellhole.\\n\\nUpdate! I initially wrote this review with one night of my stay remaining. Guess what? It got worse! The country band playing on the street on Saturday night was somehow (defying the laws of sound) louder, and played later into the evening. Once my Reefer Madness neighbors returned to their room at near 4am, they rented several porn movies and acted out scenes from them. This went on until about 8 am. I pounded on the wall twice, called the front desk, and nothing was done! I didn't sleep a wink despite the Ambien.\\n\\nI finally headed to the airport around 9 am, five hours early for my flight, because the hotel was just that damn bad, and I couldn't stand the filthiness and sleaze any longer.\\n\\nAbsolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.

I used to suggest it to all my friends, raving about the great NY style pizza, great atmosphere, and great service. Today I feel like I ate at a completely different restaurant. \\n\\nHostess was very sweet, cleaning off a table for us outside. We were sat, and then we sat. and sat. and sat. No one came over to even acknowledge us. After finally tracking down our waitress, we placed our drink orders and and ordered Mozz sticks app. About 10 min went by. Then 15, and I started wondering if they were brewing my beer behind the bar.

She was honestly acting like she had taken something the night before, or that morning who knows, and it was still in her system for sure. Seemed like she was just wandering around lost, every table she had was constantly asking for refills, their check, etc.... There was something way more wrong there than her just being \\\"new\\\". \\n\\nWhen our food finally made it, she couldn't even remember who had ordered what out of all 2 OF US AT THE TABLE. And to top it all off the food was disgusting. Mozz sticks were obviously frozen,sauce had no flavor. I got chick parm stromboli, it came out soggy, somewhat cold, and just gross. My wife got the meat ravioli, she said they were ok, probably frozen as well,but the sauce they were buried in was pretty unbearable. I remember fresh ingredients from this place, no more.....\\n\\nI don't know if something major has gone on here in the past 6 months or so, but I will never be back after this experience.

The first time was not a great experience mainly because the outside server was terrible. She never came around and it made for awkward moments when she did. I decided to give it another try and what did I get?! Another terrible experience. \\n\\nI came here on this past Thursday night around 830PM. I wish I knew who our server was because I really wanted to complain. My friend and I sat down outside at a table and then a moment later another group sat down after us. Their table received drinks and appetizers before we even got asked what we wanted to order. We honestly waited about 10-15 minutes before I decided to hunt for a server inside and ask where the patio server was.  I let that person know we have been waiting for about 10-15 minutes and  haven't been approached for anything. This server was happy to go out of her way and at least get our drinks. She was friendly and was hoping she would be our server and not the normal outside patio server. Well, unfortunately the regular outside patio server  ended up being our server for the night. We then tried being optimistic about it and went and ordered both our drinks and food because who knew when she would come around to check in. Well, later the night came and another 15 minutes or so go by without our server coming around to ask if we wanted anything. I ended up going to the bar outside and was about to order when FINALLY the server came and asked if she could help. Whelp, another awkward moment between the server and us. \\n\\nLater that night, she came around once more and said she was closing out and if she could close our table. We said \\\"Yes\\\". Let's just say that her overall service deserved a at most $1 tip just because I felt bad, but did give her a 10% tip because I'm not that mean. \\n\\nOverall, the food, was OK, the drinks were OK (little watered down on mixed drinks) and the customer service AGAIN was horrible.

We wanted to sit inside because it looked cozier than the tables in the middle of the walkway, but we were told actually they were starting to clean up in there so we would have to sit outside. No problem!\\n\\nHowever, we felt immediately like the few waitstaff were visibly upset we had been seated, particularly our waiter. He looked tired, and annoyed he had a table. So much so we literally asked him 3-4 times if it was really OK that we were sitting down to eat. He assured us it was OK if we put the order in quickly. \\n\\nOverall, they pushed the food out quickly, and we all enjoyed our pizza/pasta. For the price, this place is quite the deal on the strip. You get a lot, it's in a nice indoor location, and the food was very good. If this was a normal restaurant I would give it 3 stars (entirely because of the feeling like we were a burden, the food was great), but the value vs others around make it a 4 for me.",

    "review": "I am so torn on this review...so buyer beware.  The real reason I am giving this place 4 stars is for the hot homemade donuts that they make for desert.  There are also 2 dipping sauces too...a chocolate and a buttery carmel...I love the carmel it takes the donut to another level.\\n\\nAlso during dinner they put fresh homemade dough pretzels on the table with a butter mustard dipping sauce.  These are really good and a different twist on just throwing bread on someone's table...plus it is the only thing you can get for free at the Wynn.  I feel like a winner!\\n\\nWe went with the pre-fixed menu and it was a good deal...you could choose a starter, entree and desert for $39.  I went with the rib-eye medium rare...it was suppose to be a peppercorn rub but I was able to get it without it...thank you chef.  The steak was cooked perfectly and came with Mr. Wynn's Special Steak Sauce...wow was it good...I had to ask for more because everyone at my table was dipping all of there food in it.\\n\\nPersonally the staff is okay here...I would expect to be more impressed with this being a Wynn Property but it seems like the staff here are lacking in training.  I have never seen this place packed in all of the times we have eaten here, so maybe the really good waiters do not want to work here.\\n\\nMy buddy ordered a calamari starter and it was so fishy I would have thrown it back into the sea.  The waiter asked if it was good and he said yes...but I would have sent it back.  If I had ordered that this place would be getting one star.\\n\\nThe Mac and Cheese Bites Starter was also amazing too.  But Mac and Cheese Deep Fried better be good.\\n\\nI also started with the Lettuce Wedge with Blue Cheese and Bacon.  I had no idea that this could be bad.  First there is only one strip of bacon that was cooked two days ago sitting on top.  Maybe the Chef could have diced this up for me.  There was nice chunks of blue cheese but hardly any dressing...so it was very dry.\\n\\nSo as you can see I am giving this place 4 stars but that is for those amazing donuts...everything else is just really good or really bad.  I should just commit to the 3 stars but I can't do it.  I am just not a 3 star guy.\\n\\nOn Yelp it says that this place is Italian...there is nothing Italian about this place...there is one pasta dish but nothing else.  In fact, the menu covers ever food choice and is probably more American, then anything else.\\n\\nThere is also a full bar too, so drink up my friends it is VEGAS!",

We were asked, \\\"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHIPS & SALSA?\\\" well like at most Mexican restaurants that is the way dinner usually starts (yes, I realize this isn't a Mexican restaurant), so we said sure. Jumping ahead to get the message across to you, I get home and take a look at the receipt, well what do you know?! $5.50 charge on the check for Chips & Salsa. What really got me was that wasn't suggested as an appetizer, it was suggested as if was \\\"Would you like a glass of water?\\\" They didn't say, \\\"Would you like to start off with some potato skins or blah blah blah..\\\" Get my point? Well I called the manager on the phone about this and during one point of my complaint, she actually giggled at me!! She tried to make good and asked who my server was, but I said that I didn't blame the server I blame management for trying to \\\"up sell\\\" in a round about way. The \\\"manager\\\" then tried to make good and take if off my bill, I just said, \\\"I don't care about the $5.50, I am concerned about the way it got on to my bill in the first place\\\". What a unprofessional way to respond to a customer concern!\\n\\nPros:\\nFood wasn't horrible, but nothing outstanding about it.\\n\\nCons:\\nMy 1/2 pound burger was kind of skimpy and makes me wonder what weighs 1/2 pounds? The entire burger weight? Also my burger patty  was crumbly and was in 3 sections, all holding together for the most part but in sections. The french fries? I really dislike this micro threads of shoestring potatos. \\n\\nWife had Fettucini Alfredo with chicken. The chicken breast was sliced thin and was very very tiny, looked like 1/3 of a breast cut up as a garnish. The pasta was good, but the noodles had  what seemed to be heat lamp dryness to it. It was probably sitting and waiting to be presented together with my cooking hamburger. The Alfredo sauce was so thin it looked like it was non existent, but if you mix it up the sauce comes back up to the top and is present again.\\n\\nOverall we won't be coming back and really do not know what all the commotion is all about.

My advice is to get a second opinion when a shop like this springs something like this on you.  Unfortunately, most people just pay the price and go on.  If you are able to get a second opinion, I would encourage it.\\n\\nThe workers at this shop are friendly.  Like I said, I hope my experience was an anomaly...

I can't remember. what it was supposed to be stuffed with, but when I looked at the chicken, the \\\"stuffing\\\" was the tiny little area in the chicken.  It had no flavor at all.   The whipped potatoes were fine.  I'm not sure why I got the chicken.  So not like me.  Next time I will get the steak.  I tasted my friends dish and it was great!  \\nNow for the dessert.  That was the best part of the whole meal!  It was a ginger spice cake with a sour cream ice cream.  Delicious!\\nThe whole meal cost only $13 plus tax and tip.  \\nI under stand that these are students the are still learning, so you might not have the perfect experience.  But I think that this place is worth a trying over and over again.  If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would.",

Their ambiance downstairs is decidedly cool and feels appropriate given the genre of food.\\n\\nMy co-worker and I opted for the special of the day: verde chicken enchiladas.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were good.  The enchiladas were OK, but nothing special.  The chicken was tender, but it was just overly boring and nothing to make me say, \\\"Wow!\\\"\\n\\nWhat deserves special mention is the horrible service.  We were seated quickly, and then sat awhile waiting for our server.  He eventually made his way over, and after repeating our order a couple of times (due to language difficulties), we waited for our food.\\n\\nA decent amount of time had elapsed, but our chips and salsa were nowhere to be found.  Our chips showed up, and then thirty seconds later our lunches showed up.  I would have rather had the chips instantly while we were waiting for our food.\\n\\nAfter the food was delivered, no one checked on us for an extended period of time.  Since we needed to get back to work, we flagged down the manager (our server was too busy setting up tables to cater to the ones he already had), and asked for our check.  Instead of the manager getting our check himself, he tells our already in-attentive server to get it.  We never interacted with the server after the initial placing of the order.\\n\\nMore time elapses.....\\n\\nNow we are getting mad, because we've waited about 20 minutes after asking for our check, and the dirty dishes are still sitting in front of us.\\n\\nIt wasn't until we stood up, put our jackets on told the manager that we were leaving did he finally bring the check.\\n\\ntl;dr: Food was ok, service was horribly slow and inattentive for lunch.",

I don't know about you guys but when I get a burrito I would like all the fillings to be in every bite. I don't expect perfection because burritos are just amazing but imagine only getting a mouthful of rice or worse eating half of your burrito and realizing that there is no more meat for the other half of your burrito because it was all on one side of the burrito. \\n\\nSomething else.... I know avocados are expensive but if you are going to charge me $2.50 for guacamole please don't give me the smallest amount of guacamole you possibly can. I had to order extra guacamole on the side even then they didn't even fill the small container up. They did at first then scooped the guacamole out so it was more hollow in the center. Maybe I'm just used to Chipotle and expect the whole container to be full. \\n\\nHear our plea, Braddahs! We love you and love your food. The atmosphere and the food are what keeps us coming back.

    "review": "BURNED\\n\\nThis end of the strip seems to be full of New York style pizza places selling slices. You know the type of pizza that Jon Stewart from \\\"The Daily Show\\\" thinks is the best pizza in the world. At the end of the day, real pizza comes from Italy and not any American city. I have never truly been a fan of NY style pizza. When I'm in NY I usually only buy a slice because it's cheap, fast and I'm hungry. \\n\\nSo here I am in Las Vegas and not New York. I was really hungry and needed a bite to eat for my walk home down the street. I stopped in for a slice and they threw it in the oven. It was in the oven for rather a long time. I really wasn't in a hurry as I checked my emails and waited for it. \\n\\nI finally got my slice and I decided to bite into it. The problem was that the pizza temperature was set to nuclear radiation heat level. The piping hot cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and I couldn't get it off in time. All I could think was why didn't the person handing me the pizza slice give me a warning like, \\\"Hey be careful because it's really hot!\\\" I didn't think it was hot because my slice looked dried out and there was no steam flowing out of it. A warning or something would have been a nice gesture. I also must take responsibility because I bit into it without thinking twice but I was hungry. \\n\\nI ended up with a nasty burn on the roof of my mouth. Luckily the roof of the mouth heals fast. I had to deal with the burn pain for a couple of days. It was annoying and made me have not fond memories of this place every time I ate something in Vegas. \\n\\nI really wouldn't recommend  this place unless you were hungry and just looking for a quick and cheap fix. Six bucks for a slice is not a bad deal in Vegas considering how expensive food is around here. I really wished I would have just walked by this location. The pizza wasn't that great just like New York City. If they were going for an authentic NY style pizza, then they nailed it. My only advice is to just check the temperature before biting in or you might get BURNED.\\n\\nOn a side note there are a ton of costumed characters hanging around nearby selling photo opps. It is kind of like a freak show of costumed crazies. These characters are in no way associated with this pizza place but you are going to have to go through this mess to get here. Enjoy!",

As soon as I saw this event I knew I was going to love it. \\n\\nI've heard great things about the Pittsburgh Winery and I'm excited Yelp brought me here because I know I'm going to be returning. It is a beautifully modern space that has such a cozy and warm vibe from the second you walk in. Dim lighting is my fav because it totally makes the atmosphere chill AND makes you look better (fluorescent lights are not my friend)! Ha! The red colors, barrels lining the walls and interesting art totally added to the feel of it all. I kept mentioning how awesome it would be to spend a Friday night here rather than dealing with the craziness of any old bar. It was a bit crowded, making hard to get through with all of the tables, however it wasn't overbearing and I still had enough room to have conversation with my boyfriend, Meghan B. and her plus one, Liz. \\n\\nThe wine was very good! Unfortunately I only sampled two of their reds, but I quickly found that their Red Blend was going to be my choice for the night. Prices were a bit steep, but I suppose $8/glass is really average around the city. I do wish they would have had more of a selection and had some more sweeter options, but I was content with what I had. \\n\\nThe wine decorating was cool and my boyfriend totally did our glasses up REAL  fancy. I was much more interested in having conversation with my fellow Yelpers! I can't do two things at once apparently. \\n\\nOnto the food. My favorite of the night had to be Gaucho (obviously!!). I cannot wait to visit their shop. The pork dish was amazing. The dressing was simply fantastic. I wasn't a fan of the horseradish dish, however everyone at my table was raving about it.
