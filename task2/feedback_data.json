    "ai_response": "Thank you so much for your wonderful 5-star review! We're absolutely delighted to hear that you liked the movie. We hope you'll continue to find many more films to enjoy with us!",
    "admin_summary": "The customer is highly satisfied and enthusiastic, giving the movie a perfect 5/5 rating with a concise \"I like this movie.\" There are no issues raised and consequently no urgency for follow-up.",
    "recommended_actions": "Here are 2-3 specific, actionable recommendations based on the 5-star review \"i like this movie\":\n\n*   **Reply and Gently Encourage More Detail:** Respond directly to the customer, thanking them for their positive feedback. Include a brief, open-ended question to encourage them to elaborate on *why* they liked the movie (e.g., \"We're so glad you enjoyed it! What specifically stood out to you?\"). This helps convert a general positive into more specific, actionable insights about what aspects of your content or service are resonating.\n*   **Leverage for Broader Reach (Request Testimonial/Share):** If the review is on a platform that allows it, subtly invite the customer to share their positive experience on other relevant review sites (e.g., IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, social media) or consider providing a quick link for them to do so. This amplifies positive word-of-mouth.\n*   **Maintain and Reinforce Content/Experience Standards:** Internally, register this positive feedback as validation for your current movie selection criteria, streaming quality, or overall user experience. While the feedback is brief, it confirms that your general offering is appreciated. Continue to track overall positive sentiment to ensure these standards are consistently met."
